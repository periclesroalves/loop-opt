##### How to build:

First build LLVM and Clang 3.6
Since this project LLVMs APIs which are subject to change it is not guaranteed that building with any version of LLVM will work without requiring some minor changes.
The last known working LLVM version was git commit 75bb472c, from Oct 27 2014, and Clang git commit f898c185, from the same day, cloned from the official LLVM git mirror.
Build LLVM with the CMake build system with the flag -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON.

To run cmake on this project you have to specify the build directory of your LLVM version, either via the LLVM_DIR or CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable.
To specify where the binaries and libraries produced by this build should be installed use the -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH flag.
An example:
	cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(realpath ../build-llvm) -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH=/home/foo/tools .

You can then build via:
	make
	make install
