        About
        =====
        
        *LNT* is an infrastructure for performance testing. The software itself consists
        of two main parts, a web application for accessing and visualizing performance
        data, and command line utilities to allow users to generate and submit test
        results to the server.
        
        The package was originally written for use in testing LLVM compiler
        technologies, but is designed to be usable for the performance testing of any
        software.
