    Test names are intended to be a persistent, recognizable identifier for what
    is being executed. Currently, most formats use some form of dotted notation
    for the test name, and this may become enshrined in the format in the
    future. In general, the test names should be independent of the
    software-under-test and refer to some known quantity, for example the
    software under test. For example, 'CINT2006.403_gcc' is a meaningful test
    name.

    The test info dictionary is intended to hold information on the particular
    permutation of the test that was run. This might include variables specific
    to the software-under-test . This could include, for example, the compile
    flags the test was built with, or the runtime parameters that were used. As
    a general rule, if two test samples are meaningfully and directly
    comparable, then the should have the same test name but different info
    paramaters.

    The report may include an arbitrary number of samples for each test for
    situations where the same test is run multiple times to gather statistical
